### Data sources

UE = Eurostat; OECD; SRD; SBS

BRAZIL = IBGE; UIS(UNESCO). 

Brazil remarks:

*We have used PINTEC data by industry and correspondences between CNAE 2/CNAE 1 and NACE-Rev.2 to distribute R&D expenditure among ICT, RS and selected non-ICT sectors.

*Gross value of industrial production from Industrial Survey (IBGE) has been also used, in order to distribute the R&D expenditures between ICT Sector NACE 263 (Manufacture of communication equipment), 264 (Manufacture of consumer electronics) and 268
(Manufacture of magnetic and optical media). It has also been used to estimate NACE 303 (Manufacture of air and spacecraft and related machinery).

*ICT sector NACE 62 (Computer programming, consultancy and related activities) includes ICT sector NACE 582 (Software publishing). In addition, for Brazil there is no information for the MC sector (NACE 581, 59, 60 and 639), the ICT trade sector (NACE 465) and for one ICT services sector: 951 (Repair of computers and communication equipment)

*there is no available information on BERD at 4-digits NACE and ICT services sector’s data is only available for 2008 onwards. PINTEC 2000 and 2003 do not include information on services sectors. 

*Brazil’s dataset does not contain information for RS sector (NACE 4791) and macro-sectors NACE 45 (Wholesale and retail trade and repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles), 85 (Education) and the aggregations 49-99 (Services, except trade), 45-47 (Wholesale and retail trade, repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles), 49-53
(Transportation and storage), 58-63 (Information and communication), 64-66 (Financial and insurance activities), 69-82 (Professional, scientific, technical, administration and
support service activities), 69-75 (Professional, scientific and technical activities) and 86-88 (Human health and social work activities).Data for GERD come from UNESCO-UIS database.
We obtain BERD in euros and PPS using exchange rates and purchasing power parities coming from OECD and Eurostat.
